# mini-project
My project involved predicting asthma risk by utilizing atmospheric data collected from sensors. We harnessed the power of deep learning through a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) to train our model. The dataset we used was derived from real-world sensor data, providing a natural and authentic source of information.

In practical application, our system gauges asthma risk levels, indicating whether the risk is high, low, or medium. This information is conveyed through a user-friendly interface that incorporates LED lights for easy interpretation.
